# cs0320 Term Project

**Team Members:** Alex Sekula (asekula), Jake Tango (jtango), Loudon Cohen (lcohen2), Sam Waxman (swaxman1)

**Project Idea:** A game similar to autocorrect, but the players guess what the suggestions will be, and gain points based on how high up their guess was. It would be multiplayer, and players would compete against each other in timed matches. Google mode would consist of some text that represents the incomplete search, and players would have to guess what google would autocomplete for the search. AskReddit mode would consist of a question posted on reddit.com/r/AskReddit and users would have to guess the answers (it would only take answers with short responses so the users can realistically guess them). A third mode would be "meta mode", where the suggestions are the most common guesses based on what users in the game suggested. Similar to "meta mode", a bonus feature would be that this game learns what people would suggest given an incomplete search, and the data collected could be used to build a better autocomplete system.
