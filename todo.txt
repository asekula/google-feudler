Todo:
    1. Add appropriate error message for trying to join a full room
    2. Add a play again button at the end of multiplayer games.
    3. Add more specific queries.
    4. Custom queries.
    5. If the round has ended, set the frontend timer to 0.
    6. Displays answers to a new player who joined after the time was up.
    7. nRandomQueries -> double check that this is truly random.

If we have time:
    1. Show stopwords.
    2. Chat.
    3. Remove duplicate queries in the same room.
	4. A message at the end of the game that lets users know who won.
	5. Make room codes actual words (makes it easier to share in a group).
